# Theme Explorer


## What is it?

This is a small tool to explore visual styles (aka themes) on Windows XP and
later, as provided by `UXTHEME.DLL`.

It has been developed as an auxiliary tool to be used during the development
of the [mCtrl project](http://mctrl.org) but possibly other UI developers can
find it useful too.

The tool as well as its sources can be downloaded from mCtrl website:

## License

Theme Explorer is covered with MIT license, see the file `LICENSE.md`.


## System requirements

To run it, you need MS Windows XP or newer (because of `UXTHEME.DLL`), and to
be really useful, you must have visual styles enabled in your Windows.
