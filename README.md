## What is Theme Explorer

This is a small tool to explore visual styles (aka themes) on Windows XP and
later, as provided by UXTHEME.DLL.

It has been developed as an auxiliery tool to be used during the development
of the [mCtrl project](http://mctrl.org) but possibly other UI developers can
find it useful too.

The tool as well as its sources can be downloaded from mCtrl website:

## License

The tool is covered with GNU General Public License version 2 or (at your
option) any later version. Refer to the file COPYING for more details.


## System requirements

To run it, you need MS Windows XP or newer (because of UXTHEME.DLL), and to
be really useful, you must have visual styles enabled in your Windows.
